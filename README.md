# myr
#mýr is a machine learning project for classifying whether Mojmýr is in an image or not.

# Future
I need to build the model first (which I'm working on now) and then I can start making the application that will allow users to pass an image to it and get a positive (Mojmyr is there) or negative (Mojmyr isn't there) result.

# A little bit extra info
I got the idea to make this project at the start of summer of 2023, which I spend learning PyTorch, a library I wanted to be my tool for creating this project. After getting to section 4 of the excellent Mr. Bourke's course, I started working on #mýr, experimenting with Siamese networks that I hoped would be the best solution for my problem. Unfortunately, I ran into a whole bunch of errors and because I didn't even fully know what I was doing, this attempt ended unsuccesfully. Then, I decided to go back to what I know and built a model that replicates the TinyVGG CNN structure - and this finally worked. And that is where I'm at right now.
